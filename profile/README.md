<h3 align="center"> Open Source project - Track Expenses App</h3>

We are currently working on the Track Expenses App project for users to help them track their own expenses and incomes/revenues. Balances, which you will receive, via the app, will be based on calculation between your receivables and payables. We are developing a skeleton/bare bones/minimal version of this App for pre official-release user testing. We’re resolving interesting problems connected to architecture and implementation. We address them by using docker-compose with a database connected to Liquibase. We’re doing this to improve communication between our back-end and front-end. The User will see a user interface based on Angular which is supported by Spring Boot.
